# Neo4J Python Notebooks

This is my repo for various python notebooks where I'm working on building data science examples using Python and Neo4J. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You'll need Neo4J installed as well as the Anaconda distribution of Python (so you can use my conda environment and Jupyter).


### Conda Environment

Some of the packages I'm using don't always play nicely with other dependencies, so I use a conda environment (neo4jenvironment.yml).  To load it:

```
conda env create -f neo4j_environment.yml
conda activate neo4j
```
